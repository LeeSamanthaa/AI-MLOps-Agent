Specifically, adding a 'Bathrooms^2' feature could help the model capture the non-linear aspect of this relationship, leading to potentially better prediction accuracy. With a mean 'Bathrooms' value of 2.491 and a standard deviation of 1.118, the variance in 'Bathrooms' seems to be substantial enough to warrant inclusion of polynomial terms.",

Applying a log transformation to this feature could help mitigate its skewed distribution, making the feature more suitable for use in linear models. This is particularly important as the current distribution may lead to undue influence from extreme values, and the log transformation may help to stabilize the variance.",

Additionally, we can see that this feature has multiple categories, as evident from the 'count', 'mean', and standard deviation values. As the 'SquareFootage' feature does not have a clear relationship with the target variable 'Price' evident from the given statistics, we can apply target encoding techniques to better leverage the information contained within the 'SquareFootage' categories. This could lead to better model accuracy by incorporating meaningful representations of the 'SquareFootage' categories directly into the target model.",
