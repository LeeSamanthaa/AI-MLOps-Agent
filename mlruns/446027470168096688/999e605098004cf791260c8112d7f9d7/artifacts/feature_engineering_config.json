Binning this variable could help reduce the effect of outliers while preserving the important information about the housing size, allowing the model to better fit the target variable \"Price\". This technique can also capture non-linear relationships with the target variable, especially since the 'Price' seems to have a moderate positive correlation with 'SquareFootage'. Additionally, binning could enable faster computation if the model is computationally expensive.",
